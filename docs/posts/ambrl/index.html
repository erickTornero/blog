            <p>Introduction to the basics on model-based reinforcement learning and the recent advances on this topic.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Model-based reinforcement learning is a branch in Reinforcement Learning where the transition function <span  class="math">\(P(s', r|s, a)\)</span> in the Markov decision process (MDP) is used. This model is used to improve or create a policy (planning), where the value function is calculated as an intermediate step, as can be seen in <strong>Figure 1</strong> in the <em>model-learning</em> branch. <em>Direct RL</em>, means model-free RL where the policy or value-function is computed <em>directly</em> from experience and it is not needed to model the dynamics. However, these kinds of methods are too poor sample efficient due to that these methods rely on the probability to find good interactions, this becomes even more complicated when the environment has high dimensional state-action space and when sparse rewards are presented. In contrast, recent advances in Model-based RL, have shown capabilities to learn optimal policies with considerable less interactions, becoming methods more applicable to real-life problems.</p>

<p>An interesting algorithm for starting analysis of model-based reinforcement learning is called <strong>Dynamic Programming</strong> algorithm, where is assumed a prior and exact knowledge of the dynamics (transition function). However, in the real world, the dynamics are usually unknown and can be very complex to model. For these kinds of problems, model learning with function approximators are used just as supervised learning with the collected transitions <span  class="math">\((s, a, s')\)</span> as dataset. Examples of these environments are show <strong>Fig. 2</strong>, the left picture shows a Simple Gridworld example with a discrete state and actions. In this case the transition function is known, for example <span  class="math">\(P(s_2|s_1,right)=1.0\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(P(s_2|s_1, left)=0.0\)</span>, where <span  class="math">\(s_x\)</span>: represents the slot <span  class="math">\(x \in \{0, 15\}\)</span>. In the right picture, an environment more approximate to real world is shown: Halfcheetah in <a href="http://www.mujoco.org/">Mujoco Environment</a>, where the dynamics of this environment is unknown and complex.</p>

<p>For low dimensional state-action space, Gaussian Process (GPs) can be used to approximate the transition function. However when complexity in the model increasses, e.g. in robotics control, gaussian process used to be inadequate. Neural Networks however are known by its high adaptavility to complex functions, and in recent years, has beend showed interesting results in several applications, such as image classification. In that sense, this post focused in recent advances in MBRL that uses Neural Networks for the approximation of the transition function.</p>

<h2 id="basic-concepts-in-modelbased-reinforcement-learnig">Basic concepts in Model-Based Reinforcement Learnig</h2>

<p>Reinforcement learning Framework is defined over a Markov Decision Process, and elements in an MDP are defined in the tuple <span  class="math">\((\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{R}, \mathcal{P}, \gamma)\)</span>, where <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{S}\)</span> is the state space, <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is the action space, <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{R}\)</span> is the reward and <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P(s', r|s, a)}\)</span> define the transition function. In <strong>Fig. 3</strong>, the interaction interaction agent-envrionment is shown, given an observed state <span  class="math">\(s_t \in \mathcal{S}\)</span> at any particular timestep <span  class="math">\(t\)</span>, the agent take an action <span  class="math">\(a_t \in \mathcal{A}\)</span> drawn from its policy <span  class="math">\(\pi(a_t|s_t)\)</span>. The environment respond with the next state <span  class="math">\(s_{t+1}\)</span> and the reward <span  class="math">\(r_{t+1}\)</span> produced by take action <span  class="math">\(a_t\)</span>.</p>

<p>Either model-based or model-free methods try to compute a <strong>policy</strong> <span  class="math">\(\pi(a|s)\)</span> that maximizes the expected reward. In the case of mode-based, the policy is computed indirectly by using the transition model <span  class="math">\(\mathcal{P}(s',r|s, a)\)</span> for planning. As an example, some algorithms are explaining in the following section called: <strong>Dynamic Programming</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h3>

<p>Dynamic programming are sets of algorithms where is assumed that the environment transition function is priorly known. The aim of RL is summarized in the following equation:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\mathbb{E}[G_t] = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}[\sum_t \gamma^tr_t | s_t,a_t]\]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\mathbb{E}[G_t] = \sum_s [\sum_t v(s) | a_t]\]</span></p>

<p><span  class="math">\[v_\pi(s) = \sum_{s, r} \sum_{a} p(s'|s,a) \pi(a|s)[r + v(s)]\]</span></p>

<p>This paper proposes deterministic Neural Network for Model-based Reinforcement Learning for solving continuous taks. The pipeline is shown in <strong>Fig. 4</strong>, a Neural Network <span  class="math">\(\hat{f}_\theta\)</span> models the dynamics of the environment and is trained as a multidimensional regression in a deterministic way using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_squared_error">MSE Loss</a> function (<strong>Eq. 3</strong>). The <em>MPC Controller</em> laverage the knowledge of the transition function <span  class="math">\(\hat{f}_{\theta}\)</span> to predict the next state <span  class="math">\(\hat{s}_{t+1}\)</span> given a current state <span  class="math">\(s_t\)</span> and an action taken <span  class="math">\(a_t\)</span> as in <strong>Eq. 1</strong>. The same logic is used for multistep prediction of <em>horizon</em> <span  class="math">\(H\)</span>, by recursively applying the <strong>Eq. 1</strong> <span  class="math">\(H\)</span> times (<strong>Eq. 2</strong>). Note that reward is a function over states <span  class="math">\(r_t = fn(s_t)\)</span>, then if the state <span  class="math">\(\hat{s}_{t+i}\)</span> is predicted by <strong>Eq. 2</strong>, reward is approximate by <span  class="math">\(\hat{r}_{t+i} = fn(\hat{s}_{t+i})\)</span>.</p>

<p>This method reach aceptable results in continuous tasks, It was tested in the <a href="http://www.mujoco.org/">Mujoco Environment</a>. While this method take over 100x less samples with respect model-free methods, this method can not reach the same assimpotic performace. A second proposal uses the previous model-based for initialize a model-free method (<em>PPO</em>), this is particular useful for model-free because the sample-complexity of model-free based on the probability to see good interactions, and model-based can achieve this with few samples. The results show faster convergence for model-free methods as can be seen in <strong>Fig. 5</strong> and <strong>Fig. 6</strong> (<em>fine-tuning</em>).</p>

<p>[<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7725-deep-reinforcement-learning-in-a-handful-of-trials-using-probabilistic-dynamics-models.pdf">See paper</a>]</p>

<p>This paper achieve interesting results reducing the gap between model-free and model-based RL in assimptotic performance with 10x less sample iterations required, by mixing some ideas to model the uncertainty of the dynamics: These uncertainties are devide into two:</p>

<p><strong>1. Aleatoric Uncertainty</strong>:</p>

<p>This uncertainty is given by the stochasticity of the system, e.g. noise, inherent randomness. The paper models this behaviour by outputting the mean and variance of a <em>Gaussian Distribution</em>, It allows to model differents variances for differents states (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity">Heterokedastic</a>). While the distribution over states can be assumed any tractable distribution, this paper assumed a Gaussian Distribution over states. Given by:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\hat{f} = Pr(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t) = \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta(s_t, a_t), \Sigma{_\theta}(s_t,a_t))\]</span></p>

<p>In that sense the loss function is given by:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[loss_{Gauss}(\theta) = \sum_{n=1}^N[\mu_\theta(s_n, a_n) - s_{n+1}]^\intercal \Sigma_\theta^{-1}(s_n, a_n)[\mu_\theta(s_n, a_n) - s_{n+1}] + \dots \newline \dots + \log\det\Sigma{_\theta}(s_n, a_n)\]</span></p>

<p><strong>2. Epistemic Uncertainty</strong>:</p>

<p>This uncertainty is given by the limitation of data. Overconfidence in zones where there are not sufficient data-training points can be fatal for prediction, epistemic uncertainty tries to model this. The paper model this by using a simple bootstrap of ensembles. In <strong>Fig. 4</strong>, an example of two ensembles is shown (red and blue). In zones where there are data for training, the two ensembles behaive very similar, but in zones where not, for example between the two markable zones of datapoints, each ensemble can take different behaivor, these differences represents an uncertainty due to the missing of data or <em>epistemic uncertainty</em>.</p>

<h3 id="anusha-nagabandi-et-al-uc-berkeley-2019">Anusha Nagabandi et al. UC Berkeley 2019</h3>

<p>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.11652.pdf">See paper</a>]</p>

<p>This paper is an extention of the previous paper <em>DRL with a handful of trials using probabilistic models (PETS)</em>, taking the problem of dexterous manipulation. It also models aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties with Gaussian parametrization via Neural Networks and with Ensembles bootstrap respectively. The main contributions is a modification for (MPPI) algorithm that uses weighted rewards. MPPI uses random sampling techniques to explore actions near to the control sequence, instead in this paper a <em>Filtering</em> technique is used to add dependencies of previous timesteps:</p>

<p><strong>Filtering and reward weighted refinement overview</strong>:</p>

<p>Given a sequence control:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[(\mu_0, \mu_1, \dots, \mu_{H-1})\]</span></p>

<p>It is assumed that the control sequence is a future sequence of lenght <span  class="math">\(H\)</span>. This sequence is optimized every timestep and <span  class="math">\(\mu_0\)</span> should be the control input to be taken at current timestep. Noises is added in the following way:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\(u_t^i \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma) \hspace{0.25cm} \forall i \in \{0\dots N-1\}, t \in \{0\dots H-1\}\)</span>POPLIN-A-Init):**</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[n_t^i = \beta u_t^i + (1 - \beta) n_{t-1}^i \hspace{0.25cm}\text{where}\hspace{0.25cm} n_{t<0} = 0\]</span></p>

<p>Where <span  class="math">\(u_t^i\)</span> is a gaussian noise with mean <span  class="math">\(0\)</span> and <span  class="math">\(\Sigma\)</span> covariance matrix and <span  class="math">\(n_t^i\)</span> add dependace noise from previous timestep.</p>

<p>Then each action for H (index <span  class="math">\(t\)</span>) horizon for N (index <span  class="math">\(i\)</span>) candidates is computed as:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[a_t^i = \mu_t + n_t^i\]</span></p>

<p>With the previous actions sequence for N candidates, the predicted states is computed with the dynamics model, then the reward <span  class="math">\(R_k\)</span> is computed for each trajectory. Then the new mean is computed through the weighted reward.</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\mu_t = \frac{\sum_{k=0}^N (e^{\gamma R_k})(a_t^{(k)})}{\sum_{j=0}^N e^{\gamma R_j}} \hspace{0.25cm} \forall t \in \{0\dots H-1\}\]</span></p>

<p>Now, the new trajectory is optimized <span  class="math">\(\mu_{0:H-1}\)</span>. Just the first action is taken: <strong><span  class="math">\(\mu_0\)</span></strong> (Send to actuators).</p>

<p>Finally, the control sequence is updated, and the process is repeated for each timestep:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\[\mu_i = \mu_{i+1} \hspace{0.25cm} \forall i \in \{0\dots H-2\}, \hspace{0.25cm} \mu_{H-1} = \mu_{init}\]</span></p>

<h3 id="tingwu-wang--jimmy-ba-university-of-toronto-vector-institute-2019">Tingwu Wang &amp; Jimmy Ba, University of Toronto, Vector Institute 2019</h3>

<p>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.08649.pdf">See paper</a>]</p>

<p>This work is a derivation from the previous method presented <em>(PETS)</em>. However, in this paper, it is used a policy network to help in the planning task with iterative Cross Entropy Method.</p>

<p>Several variations is proposed in this paper, in following subsections, it is discussed how the algorithm search for trajectories: <strong>POPLIN-A</strong> (adding noise to actions) <strong>POPLIN-P</strong> (adding noise to parameters e.g. weights of a neural network). In both cases the same heuristic of Iterative Cross Entropy Method (CEM) are used (iteratively adjustment of a gaussian distribution parameters to a group of elites which obtain the best rewards), but with the difference that <strong>POPLIN</strong> uses a policy network to initializate action distribution instead of random actions as <em>PETS</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Policy Planning in Action Space (POPLIN-A)</strong>:</p>

<p>This algorithm uses Iterative Cross Entropy Method as <em>PETS</em>, however, istead of random initialization, it laverages the policy network to initializate distribution of action sequences. This initializations can be done in two ways:</p>

<p><strong>POPLIN-A-Init:</strong> Be <strong>a</strong><span  class="math">\(_i = \{\hat{a}_i, \hat{a}_{i+1}\dots \hat{a}_{i+H} \}\)</span>, a sequence of actions obtained by the iteration of the policy <span  class="math">\(\hat{a}_t = \pi(\hat{s}_t)\)</span> over the model <span  class="math">\( p(\hat{s}_{t+1}| \hat{s}_t, \hat{a}_t)\)</span> starting from <span  class="math">\(s_i\)</span>. For the exploration process, Gaussian noise is added to this initial sequence, starting with <span  class="math">\(\mu_0 = 0\)</span> and covariance <span  class="math">\(\Sigma_0 = \sigma_0^2\mathcal{I}\)</span>. Then this mean and covariance is iteratively updated by selecting <span  class="math">\(\xi\)</span> elites, and computing the new mean and new covariance.</p>

<p><strong>POPLIN-A-Replan:</strong> In <em>POPLIN-A-Init</em>, first, the action sequence is initialized, then the noise is added to this sequence. However in <em>POPLIN-A-Replan</em>, the first action is approximate by the policy, then noise is added to this action, the next state is computed taking into account this noise <span  class="math">\(\hat{s}_{i+1} = p(\cdot | s_i, \pi(s_i) + \delta_i)\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Policy Planning in Parameter Space (POPLIN-P)</strong>:</p>

<p>In planning in parameter space, gaussian noise is added to the weights of the neural network. Then exploration is made in the following way:</p>

<p><span  class="math">\(\hat{a}_i = \pi_{\theta + \omega_t}(s_t)\)</span>
<span  class="math">\(s_{t+1} = p(\cdot | s_t, \hat{a}_t)\)</span></p>

<p>Where <span  class="math">\(\omega_t\)</span> is gaussian noise, as in <em>POPLIN-A</em>, gaussian noise parameters is updated with the Iterative CEM.</p>
