Meta-learning is one of the hottest topic of research, in recent years, many researchers have taken interested on meta-learning due to its promise to reach *generalization*. In this blogpost we present a brief introduction in concepts and few applications to be introduced on this wonderful field.

## Introduction

When we start to study many of the probles that machine learning is able to solve, such us classification, regression or reinforcement learning. Usually they are solved in a way that the model is able to solve just that specific problem, arising problems, when out of distribution testing examples are given to our model. However, we can see that these two task could be very similar, so the question is: Can we take advantage of the previous learned model to solve this new task?.

One can notice that humans or animals are able to learn a task quickly when they have a prior knowladge on another similar task. For instance, driving a motorcycle when befores there's a knowladge in how to drive a byke, or how babies start to walk, using its knowladge in how to stand up. Naive machine learning techniques usually are not able to do things like that. So, we can understand *meta-learning as one of the fields that try to take advantage of prior knowladge of many tasks to learn as quickly as possible a related new task.*
