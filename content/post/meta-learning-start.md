Meta-learning is one of the hottest topics of research. In recent years, many researchers have taken interested in meta-learning due to its promise to reach *generalization*. In this blog post, we present a brief introduction to concepts in meta-learning and some applications which will immerse you in this wonderful field.

## An starting point of view

When we start to study many of the problems that machine learning can solve, such as classification, regression, or reinforcement learning. Usually, they are solved in a way that the model can solve just that specific problem. However, problems arise when out of distribution testing examples are given to our model. So, an interesting question rise: Can we take advantage of the previously learned tasks to solve a new unknown task?.

One can notice that humans or animals can learn a task quickly when they have prior knowledge on another similar task. For instance, driving a motorcycle is an esier task when before you know how to ride a bike, or how babies start to walk, using its knowledge in how to stand up. Naive machine learning techniques usually are not able to do things like that. So, we can understand *meta-learning as one of the fields that try to take advantage of prior knowledge of many tasks to learn as quickly as possible a related new task.*
